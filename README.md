## About Me

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Konrad Hernandez and I am currently a computer science major, math minor, graduate of California State University of Long Beach. The intricacies of game and web development began to lure my eye and after starting to develop my first game through Unity, the passion began. This new passion introduced me to not only creating an environment completely out of my own imagination using code, but also by showing me animation, level design, and working with different types of UIs. I worked as a web developer for Associated Students Inc., where I managed four websites including ASIRecreation, ASICorporate, 22WEST and the StudentGovernment site. Through managing these sites I have not only gained experience in web development, but also in working with a team and becoming acustom to a professional work environment and further deveolp my skills.
