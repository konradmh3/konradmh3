## About Me

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Konrad Hernandez and I am currently in my fourth year at California State University of Long Beach. I believe that computer science is not something that can be 
pursued without a passion towards the subject. As I have gone through my lectures and labs at CSULB I have began to notice that no matter who wants to learn how to code, the best 
programmers begin with those who already possess the passion to understand and create through code. When I first began college, school wasn't a priority because my passions were
elsewhere. However, throughout my progressions, I begun to meet people in my classes who had obtained this passion for computer science and I began to take interest in them. Some 
who already have full career jobs and others who have been creating applications and websites just for fun since fourteen. Dissecting computer science showed my options are vast.
However, quickly, the intricacies of game development began to lure my eye and after starting my first game through introducing myself to unity, the fire began. This new passion
introduced me to not only creating an environment completely out of my own imagination using code, but also by introducing myself to animation, level design, and working with different types of UIs.
